# DECT K2HPO4 Calibration 

The code has been modified for use with the Mindways solid CT K2HPO4 calibration phantom with five rods labelled A to E. <br>

 The code for DECT_K2HPO4_Calibration.py was adapted from the University of Calgary Bonelab DECT_PhantomCalibration.py script (https://github.com/Bonelab/DECT_BoneAnalysis/tree/master) for converting Houndsfield Units in CT images to equivalent K2HPO4 units. <br>
